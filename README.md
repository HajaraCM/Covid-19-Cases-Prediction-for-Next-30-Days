# Covid-19-Cases-Prediction-for-Next-30-Days

will introduce you to a machine learning project on Covid-19 cases prediction with Python for the next 30 days. These types of predictive models help in providing an accurate prediction of epidemics, which is essential for obtaining information on the likely spread and consequences of infectious diseases.

Governments and other legislative bodies rely on these kinds of machine learning predictive models and ideas to suggest new policies and assess the effectiveness of applied policies.
