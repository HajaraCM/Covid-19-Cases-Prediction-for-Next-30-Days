# Covid-19-Cases-Prediction-for-Next-30-Days

Time series forecasting is a technique for the prediction of events through a sequence of time. Time series forcasting decomposes the historical data into the basline,trend and seasonality.

This is a machine learning project on Covid-19 cases prediction with Python for the next 30 days. These types of predictive models help in providing an accurate prediction of epidemics, which is essential for obtaining information on the likely spread and consequences of infectious diseases.Governments and other legislative bodies rely on these kinds of machine learning predictive models and ideas to suggest new policies and assess the effectiveness of applied policies.

here I used the Facebook prophet model for the task of Covid-19 cases prediction with Python for the next 30 days. Facebook prophet model uses time series method for forecasting. 

## Technologies
The analysis is done in google colab at [https://colab.research.google.com.](https://colab.research.google.com)The main technologies used are: Pandas, Numpy, Facebook Prophet, Plotly, Matplotlib inline.

## Instalation Guide

* `!pip install pystan`
* `!pip install prophet`

## Usage

The main file is the covid19_30days_future_prediction.ipnyb jupyter notebook. you should open it in google colab and run it completely in order to see the graphs.

for the upload of the files should be selected during the run. There are three files to upload and the cells to do it are the ones with this code.

`from google.colab import files`

 `uploaded= files.upload()`
